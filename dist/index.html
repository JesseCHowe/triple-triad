            Triple Triad (トリプルトライアード, Toripuru Toraiādo?) is a popular
            card game in the world of Final Fantasy VIII available as a
            minigame. Designed by battle system planner Takayoshi Nakazato,[1]
            Triple Triad is a sidequest whose cards can be refined into items
            via Quezacotl's Card Mod ability. Many of the game's rarer items are
            most easily found by refining the cards.

          <p>
            According to the Final Fantasy VIII Ultimania, the card game was
            created by a psychic named Orlan who modified fortune-telling cards
            for use in a game, coining the name "Triple Triad."[2] Triple Triad
            was initially played among soldiers, but spread to the common people
            and by the time of Final Fantasy VIII's events, the game is popular
            among all age groups.
          </p>
          <h2>How To Play</h2>
          <p>
            Triple Triad is played on a three-by-three (3x3) square grid of
            blank spaces where the cards will be placed. Each card has four
            numbers (known as ranks) placed in top left corner; each number
            corresponds to one of the four sides of the card. The ranks range
            from one to nine, the letter A representing ten.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a basic game each player has five cards. A coin-flip decides who
            begins. The player who wins the coin toss may choose a card to play
            anywhere on the grid. After the first card is played, the opponent
            may play a card on any unoccupied space on the board. The game
            continues with players' turns alternating.
          </p>
          <h2>Winning</h2>
          <p>
            To win, a majority of the total ten cards played (including the one
            card that is not placed on the board) must be of the player's card
            color. To capture a card, the active player places a card adjacent
            to the opponent's card. If the rank touching the opponent's card is
            higher, the opponent's card will be captured and flipped into the
            active player's color. A card can be placed on any open spot on the
            board. The player who goes second will have a card remaining in
            their hand and that card will count towards their ending score. Each
            player may play one card per turn.
          </p>
          <p>
            A draw occurs if at the end the player and the opponent possess
            equal numbers of cards in their color. Depending on alternate card
            rules, this can be defined by a sudden death scenario where the game
            continues until a winner is defined. The winner takes one or more of
            the loser's cards, depending on the trade rules in effect.
